Types of Pointers:
(1) Wild Pointer: A pointer where the user declares the pointer but doesnâ€™t initialise it with any value.
Consequently it ends up pointing to any random memory location. (Returns garbage value)
Due to this, you might get some undefined behaviour and crashes. We can also get segmentation fault.
(2) Null Pointer: If we want to have a pointer variable which is just declared but want to store address later, we can use Null Pointer.
We can't deference Null Pointer, we will get runtime error and program terminates immediately.
(3) Dangling Pointer: A pointer that points to a memory location that is not valid.
(4) Void Pointer: A pointer that can point to any datatype value. 
These pointers can't be dereferenced. So, we can use Type Casting.
