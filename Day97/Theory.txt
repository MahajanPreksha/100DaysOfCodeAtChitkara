Traversal of linked list: Head can help to access the entire linked list.

Insertion at kth position in a singly linked list:
(1) At the start of the head: Time Complexity- O(1)
(2) At the end of the list: Time Complexity- O(n) [If tail pointer is passed, then O(1)]
(3) At an arbitrary position: O(k) or O(n) in worst case

Updation at kth position in a singly linked list:
Time Complexity is O(k) but O(n) in worst case
