Vectors are dynamic arrays, they can be resized when you want to insert/delete elements.
Contiguous memory allocated
#include<vector> is the header file for Vectors
Declaration: vector<datatype> vector_name; OR vector<datatype> vector_name(size);
Size/Length: v.size();
Resize: v.resize(new_size);
Capacity: v.capacity();
capacity>=size for a vector; it changes dynamically; increases in the power of 2
Add Elements: v.push_back(element); adds element at the end
v.insert(position, element); adds element at the specific position
Position of first element: v.begin();
Position of last element: v.end();
Delete Elements: v.pop_back(); deletes last element
v.erase(position); deletes element relative to first element
v.clear(); deletes all elements
