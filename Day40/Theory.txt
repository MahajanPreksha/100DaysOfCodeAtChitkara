Pointer Arithmetic: for incrementing and decrementing operations; different from Integer Arithmetic
Increment/Decrement Operations: shift in memory location that the pointer is pointing
Increment Operation: Points towards subsequent memory location
ptr + x stores the address (ptr + x*sizeofdatatypeofx)
We can use ++ and -- for pointers too.
*(++ptr): first move pointer by n bytes (depends upon datatype) and then dereference
++(*ptr): first deference, then increment the dereferenced value
cout<<arr: returns the address of arr[0];
cout<<*arr: returns the value of arr[0];
*(arr+1): value of 1st index
We can use pointer to point towards entire array.
