Quick Sort is based on Divide and Conquer Paradigm.
Example: 10, 3, 7, 9, 1, 8 --> 7 is at the correct position w.r.t sorted array. //Choose 8 as partition element
(1) 3, 7, 1, 8, 10, 9 //Choose 1 as partition element 9 as partition element
(2) 1, 3, 7, 8, 9, 10 //Choose 7 as partition element
(3) 1, 3, 7, 8, 9, 10
Last element --> Partition element --> Pivot element (for simplicity)
Choosing the pivot element (variations):
(1) Last element
(2) First element
(3) Median element
(4) Random element
Time Complexity:
Best Case- O (n*log n)
Worst Case- O(n*n)
Average Case- O(n*log n)
Space Complexity: O(n)
Quick Sort is not a stable sorting algorithm.
Applications of Quick Sort Algorithm:
(1) where memory is a concern
(2) inbuilt sorting algorithms
Merge Sort vs Quick Sort:
(1) Merge Sort:
- large datasets
- stable
- linked list
(2) Quick Sort:
- smaller datasets
- unstable
- not for linked list
- where memory is a concern
