Procedure Oriented Programming:
- Conventional programming paradigm that uses high level languages like: C, COBOL, FORTRAN
- Programs are divided into tasks and grouped into functions
- Global data: accessible from entire program
- Demerits of global data: difficult to track which function changes data and if data structure is changed, functions need to be revised
Object Oriented Programming:
- Main focus on data
- Bind the data to the function using it
- Program is divided into objects which are further divided into data and functions
- Protects data from accidental changes
Class: It is the fundamental unit of OOPs. It is a user defined data type.
Example: Class Fruit --> Properties: colour, taste --> Variables: Mango, Apple, Grapes (Objects)
Objects: Objects are variables of type Class.
By default, objects of a class are private. To access the properties, we need to use public.
