Insertion Sort Algorithm: Repeatedly take elements from unsorted sub-array and insert in sorted sub-array
Example: 11, 8, 15, 9, 4
(1) 8, 11, 15, 9, 4
(2) 8, 11, 15, 9, 4
(3) 8, 9, 11, 15, 4
(4) 4, 8, 9, 11, 15
Time Complexity: O(n^2) [Worst Case]; Omega(n) [Best Case]
Space Complexity: O(1)
Applications of Insertion Sort:
(1) where there are few unsorted elements
(2) where array is almost sorted
Insertion Sort is a Stable Sorting Algorithm
